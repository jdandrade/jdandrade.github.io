#### Who am I?
My name is João Andrade and I'm an Android Developer for 2+ years @ [Aptoide](https://www.aptoide.com). I have a BSc in Computer Science Engineering and I am currently pursuing my MSc in the same field.

#### Why am I writting?
My ultimate goal is to constantly improve my productivity and the quality of my CS skills. I want to document my learnings and write about stuff I don't know. 
This will motivate me to learn about something I would like to write. I will write based on my opinion and knowledge that I adquire from online sources.

#### What am I writting about?
From Software development, Engineering, Architecture, Productivity and many other things I feel like I would like to write about.
